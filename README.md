The given instructions are asking to implement the time_calculator() function in the time_calculator.py file. 
For testing the function, a main.py file is provided which imports the time_calculator() function and runs it to check its output.

The unit tests for the time_calculator() function are provided in the test_module.py file.
These tests are imported in the main.py file for convenience. When the "run" button is clicked in the coding environment,
the main.py file is executed, which in turn executes the time_calculator() function and the unit tests in test_module.py.
The test results are displayed in the console, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.
